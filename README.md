# Intelligent-CPU-Scheduling-Round-Robin

Intelligent CPU Scheduling application in C implementing **Round Robin scheduling** with **dynamic Gantt chart visualization** and accurate computation of scheduling metrics.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a **CPU Scheduler** based on **Operating System principles**.  
It focuses on **process management**, **time-sharing**, and **fair CPU allocation** using the **Round Robin algorithm**.

The scheduler dynamically visualizes execution order through a **Gantt Chart** and calculates key performance metrics used in OS scheduling.
